# Visual-Basics-2008
All my projects on Visual Basics

Starting May the 1st 2017, I did some minor projects on visual basics. 
I'm using a very old version (2008), but I didn't have any problems with that.
I followed the tutorials on howtostartprogramming.com, as this was the first thing
I stumbled upon (very scientific way to choose starting points, I must admit ^^).
